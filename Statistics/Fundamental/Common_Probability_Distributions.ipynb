    "### Definition\n",
    "The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of trials, where:\n",
    "- Each trial is independent.\n",
    "- Each trial results in one of two possible outcomes (success or failure).\n",
    "- The probability of success remains constant across trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "- **n**: Number of trials.\n",
    "- **p**: Probability of success in each trial.\n",
    "- **X**: Random variable representing the number of successes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n",
    "P(X = k) = C(n, k) * (p^k) * (1 - p)^(n - k)\n",

    "- k: Number of successes\n",
    "- n: Number of trials\n",
    "- p: Probability of success\n",
    "\n",

    "3. **Sports**: Number of successful free throws in basketball.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Example: Product Quality Testing\n",
    "- **Scenario**: Testing 20 light bulbs with a 5% defect rate.\n",
    "- **Goal**:\n",
    "  - Compute P(X = 2): Probability of finding exactly 2 defective bulbs.\n",

    "- Events occur independently.\n",
    "- Events occur at a constant average rate (λ).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "- **λ**: The average number of events in the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n",

    "2. **Website Traffic**: Number of user complaints or requests per day.\n",
    "3. **Manufacturing**: Number of machine failures in a shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Example: Website Traffic\n",
    "- **Scenario**: Average of 3 complaints per day.\n",
    "- **Goal**:\n",
    "  - Compute P(X = 5): Probability of receiving exactly 5 complaints.\n",

    "## 3. Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that models data clustering around a mean value. It is symmetric, with the mean, median, and mode being equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "- **μ**: Mean (central value).\n",
    "- **σ**: Standard deviation (spread or variability).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Density Function (PDF)\n",
    "f(x) = (1 / (σ * sqrt(2 * π))) * e^(-(x - μ)^2 / (2 * σ^2))\n",

    "- μ: Mean\n",
    "- σ: Standard deviation\n",
    "- x: Value of the random variable\n",

    "1. **Human Characteristics**: Heights, weights, IQ scores.\n",
    "2. **Employee Productivity**: Task completion times.\n",
    "3. **Stock Market**: Daily returns on stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Example: Employee Productivity\n",
    "- **Scenario**: Average task time of 50 minutes with a standard deviation of 10 minutes.\n",
    "- **Goal**:\n",
    "  - Compute P(40 ≤ X ≤ 60): Probability of task completion between 40 and 60 minutes.\n",
    "  - Compute P(X > 70): Probability of task taking more than 70 minutes.\n",
    "- **Significance**: Helps in workload planning and understanding typical task durations.\n",

    "## 4. Exponential Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "The exponential distribution models the time between events in a Poisson process. It is often used to model waiting times and assumes that:\n",
    "- Events occur continuously and independently.\n",
    "- The rate (λ) of events is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter\n",
    "- **λ**: The rate of events per unit time.\n",

    "- **Scenario**: Average response time of 10 minutes per ticket.\n",
    "- **Goal**:\n",
